# This is task which was used in Ship to Internship 2021 - Idemia Poland Recruting Event
Check our [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/623894212323000)

In docs there is task manual what you have to do.
In source there is a working example of our implementation.
In e2e-tests there is script and test-vectors we were using during that event.

Every phase hase its own branch:
* 1-phase
* 2-phase
* 3-phase
* 4-phase
* 5-phase

Remember that backward compability between phases is not required so our application doesn't support it.
