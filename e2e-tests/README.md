# Running tests automatically
**Works only on LINUX**
To run tests just execute phaseX.sh script. The only requirement is that you need to use the symlinks for src and pom.xml.

# Running tests manually
In folder test-vectors you have folder for specific phases like phase1, phase2, etc. In those folders there are cases directoreis. You can just copy the _in files and check if it is the same as _expected file for the same index.

*For example:*
For input 01_input_in you should compare result of 01_input_expected.
